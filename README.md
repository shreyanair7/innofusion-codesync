# Mobile Health App Analysis – Compliance, Usability & Adoption

## Overview
This project analyzes mobile health applications to understand how regulatory compliance, usability, engagement, and communication features impact user trust, ratings, and adoption.

## Objectives
- Understand variables related to compliance, engagement, communication with caregivers/clinicians, and user experience
- Prepare and clean survey-based data for analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends
- Apply machine learning (optional) to predict ratings or adoption metrics
- Generate actionable insights to improve user confidence and market success

## Dataset
The dataset contains survey-based evaluations of mobile health applications, including compliance indicators, usability feedback, engagement features, and platform-specific ratings.

## Data Preparation
Key preprocessing steps include handling structured missing values, standardizing survey responses, encoding binary variables, and engineering composite metrics such as compliance and usability scores.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA focuses on aggregated and frequency-based visualizations to account for the discrete and survey-driven nature of the dataset.

## Insights & Recommendations
The analysis highlights the importance of regulatory trust, usability, and adoption signals in driving app success.
